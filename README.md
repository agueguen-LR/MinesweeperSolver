# MinesweeperSolver

Minesweeper Solver I developped before starting University, December 2022.

It is designed to work on the MinesweeperX.exe application (which needs to be placed at the top left of the screen). Here's a video of a successful solve : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cOZrq5EZK0](url)

It uses the pixel colour in screenshots to determine game info and control the mouse accordingly.

## IMPORTANT

I made this before knowing what Object Oriented Programming was, therefore, I coded this in C# as if C# were just statically typed Python.

The code is commented pretty thoroughly, but I obviously didn't follow good coding practices since I didn't know what those were at the time.

## Tools
Made in C# as a Windows Forms App in Microsoft Visual Studio
